              <li>
                We believe that the Bible is the inspired, the only infallible,
                authoritative, and sufficient Word of God.
              </li>
              <li>
                We believe that there is one God, eternally existent in three
                persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
              </li>
              <li>
                We believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, His virgin
                birth, His sinless life, His miracles, His vicarious and atoning
                death through His shed blood, His bodily resurrection, His
                ascension to the right hand of the Father, and His personal
                return in power and glory.
              </li>
              <li>
                We believe that for the salvation of lost and sinful man,
                regeneration by the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential and that
                this can occurs only through the ministry of the Word of God.
              </li>
              <li>
                We believe that a person becomes justified by grace alone
                through faith alone in the Lord Jesus Christ alone.
              </li>
              <li>
                We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit by whose
                indwelling presence, the Christian is progressively sanctified
                and finally glorified. This work of the Spirit in sanctification
                occurs only through the ministry of the Word of God. As this
                sanctification occurs a believer is made sufficient for all
                things to the glory of God in Christ.
              </li>
              <li>
                We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost;
                the saved are raised unto life eternal; the lost, those who
                reject Christ as Savior and Lord, are raised unto eternal
                damnation.
              </li>
              <li>
                We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in our Lord Jesus
                Christ and that we ought to manifest that unity wherever and
                whenever possible. Yet, we also believe in the need to discern
                and distinguish ourselves from those who hold to doctrines and
                philosophies that do not deepen a believer's dependence upon
                Christ and His Word.

              Biblical Counseling is a Christ-centered, church-based,
              all-inclusive, and empathetic, personal evangelistic, one-another
              ministry that depends upon the power of the Holy Spirit and the
              sufficiency, inerrancy and the authority of the Holy Scripture
              (Sola Scriptura) by which Christians must assess all other truth
              claims.

              Biblical Counseling encourages believers struggling with sinful
              life issues. Moreover, Biblical Counseling offers biblical hope
              and encouragement to people living with non-physical life
              challenges and with chronic and/or life-threatening physical life
              troubles, and is a process of focused and personal discipleship.
