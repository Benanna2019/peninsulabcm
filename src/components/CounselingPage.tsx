                When it comes to training, “reproducing after our own kind”.
                Only experienced, godly, “orthodox” pastors can wholly train
                other would-be pastors. One who has never pastored a church,
                “people or the invisible church” is limited in equipping men for
                vital pastoral “Ephesians 4:12-16” functions which they have
                never performed. At the Peninsula Biblical Counseling Ministries
                (PBCM), pastor-professors give men the pastoral knowledge and
                equipping they need to become successful pastor and teachers of
                men and the biblical foundation to enter any “Seminary”.

                In an era where many pastors have given up the biblical
                approach, training their own, and have handed that
                responsibility over to seminars, agencies and other outside
                institutions. The Peninsula Biblical Counseling Ministries
                (PBCM) seeks to produce pastors who can reproduce themselves in
                the church. The pastor-professors of the Peninsula Biblical
                Counseling Ministries (PBCM) train laypeople for ministry in
                their own churches, and train prospective pastors for vocational
                ministry at the seminary level.

                a pastor in the church. God places much responsibility on the
